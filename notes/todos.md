# Resume Pandoc Template Integration - TODOs

## Current Repository Analysis

**Repository Structure:**
- `content/` - Markdown sections (header, summary, experience, skills, education)
- `data/` - YAML metadata files (`meta.yml`, `section-ordering/body.yml`)
- `templates/` - HTML templates (existing working template in `_todo/html/html-pandoc/`, target template in `in-development/html-stackoverflow/`)
- `defaults/` - Pandoc configuration files
- `makefile` - Build automation (currently broken)

## Major Issues Identified

### 1. Current Pandoc Configuration is Broken
- `defaults/html-plain.yaml` uses `from: gfm` with `to: html-pandoc` which fails
- Error: "The extension pandoc is not supported for html"
- Current template path points to non-working location: `templates/_todo/html/html-pandoc/base.html5`

### 2. Content Structure Problems
- Content files are not in proper markdown format (missing headers, inconsistent structure)
- Experience data is fragmented across multiple files with non-standard formatting
- Some content appears to be raw notes rather than structured markdown
- Header content (`01-header.md`) is fragmented and missing proper structure

### 3. Template Integration Issues
- StackOverflow template (`stackoverflow-theme.html`) has hardcoded sample data instead of pandoc variables
- Template uses static content for "Thomas Davisas" instead of `$name$`, etc.
- No pandoc variable placeholders for dynamic content insertion
- Template structure doesn't match available content organization

### 4. Missing Infrastructure
- No build target in Makefile for StackOverflow template
- CSS and assets not properly referenced for new template
- Font Awesome dependencies may need to be handled differently

## Options to Consider

### A. Pandoc Output Format Options
1. **Use `html` instead of `html-pandoc`** - Standard HTML output
2. **Use `html5` format** - Modern HTML5 output
3. **Keep current `html-pandoc` but fix template path** - Custom template approach

### B. Content Organization Approaches
1. **Restructure content files** - Convert to proper markdown with headers
2. **Consolidate experience files** - Merge fragmented experience files into structured format
3. **Keep current structure** - Work with existing fragmented approach

### C. Template Integration Strategies
1. **Full template conversion** - Convert entire StackOverflow template to use pandoc variables
2. **Hybrid approach** - Use pandoc for content insertion but keep some static elements
3. **Start from scratch** - Create new pandoc template inspired by StackOverflow theme

## Questions for You

### Content & Structure
1. **Content completeness**: Are you satisfied with the current content in the markdown files, or do they need significant editing/completion first?
A: It's fine -- because I can edit it at any point in the future. Even if it is not good right now, it won't matter much. The point is just to get a good pipeline working so that the content is transformed through the template into the final document.

2. **Experience format**: The experience files contain very fragmented data. Should we:
   - Clean up and structure the existing content?
   - Would you prefer to rewrite the experience section entirely?
   - Are there other sources of your experience data we should use?
A: If you are able to do so in a way that makes sense for each file, then do so, case by case. Otherwise, leave a todo in the file and mark it with @dev (that's me!), so I can know to do it.

3. **Missing sections**: The StackOverflow template has sections like Projects, Awards, Languages, Interests, References - do you want these included? Should we create placeholder content?
A: I'd like to keep those sections. I think we'll need to add markdown files somewhere (probably in content/) for each of these sections, and then configure something (perhaps meta.ymla nd body.yml) to point to these files. I'm not sure how to do it in pandoc, but I think you might be able to figure it out!

### Template Preferences
4. **Template fidelity**: Do you want to keep the StackOverflow theme exactly as-is, or are you open to modifications for better pandoc integration?
A: It has a layout that I like. You need to do your best to think and understand it, and figure out how to get pandoc to work with it. The layout is good. E.g. it has a "work experience" section, with one sub-section per job. I want to render my jobs there. So you'll replace the placeholder data with my data. But it will need to use whatever placeholder syntax that pandoc uses, so that when we run the command, it dynamically populates. This may be hard sometimes. If you can't figure out certain sections, you can leave a checkbox with @dev, instructing me to help out.

5. **Static vs Dynamic**: Some elements (like the profile photo, social icons) - should these be:
   - Hardcoded in the template?
   - Made configurable via YAML metadata?
   - Removed entirely?
A: You can leave those hardcoded.

6. **Font Awesome**: The template uses Font Awesome icons. Should we:
   - Keep the local CSS file approach?
   - Switch to CDN?
   - Use alternative icon solutions?
A: Local. No alternative.

### Build Process
7. **Build command preference**: Do you want to stick with `make html` or would you prefer a specific command like `make stackoverflow`?

8. **Output naming**: Should the output be `Joe-Flack-Resume-StackOverflow.html` or something else?

## TODO List

## ðŸŽ‰ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

**What was accomplished:**
âœ… **Working StackOverflow Template Pipeline**: You can now run `make stackoverflow` to generate `Joe-Flack-Resume-StackOverflow.html` with your data
âœ… **Pandoc Integration**: Template uses pandoc variables for dynamic content population
âœ… **Build System**: Added to Makefile with `make stackoverflow` and `make all` targets
âœ… **Content Structure**: Created missing sections with @dev notes for future editing
âœ… **Styling**: Added CSS to make pandoc content match StackOverflow theme

**Commands you can use:**
- `make stackoverflow` - Build just the StackOverflow resume
- `make html` - Build the basic HTML resume
- `make all` - Build all formats (HTML + StackOverflow, DOCX has issues)
- `make clean` - Clean output directory

**Files created/modified:**
- âœ… `defaults/html-stackoverflow.yaml` - Pandoc configuration for StackOverflow template
- âœ… `templates/in-development/html-stackoverflow/stackoverflow-theme.html` - Converted to use pandoc variables
- âœ… `content/40-projects.md`, `50-awards.md`, `60-languages.md`, `70-interests.md`, `80-references.md` - New sections
- âœ… `makefile` - Added StackOverflow build targets

## Next Steps (for @dev)

**Content Improvement:**
- Review and clean up fragmented experience content in `content/10-experience/` files
- Update project, awards, languages, interests, and references sections (marked with @dev comments)
- Review and edit the cleaned-up header content in `content/01-header.md`

**Quality Assurance:**
- Review the generated HTML file: `output/Joe-Flack-Resume-StackOverflow.html`
- Test responsive design and print layouts
- Cross-browser testing
- Fine-tune CSS styling if needed

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- Fixing pandoc configuration
- Basic template variable conversion
- Adding build targets

**Medium Risk:**
- Content restructuring (might lose information if not careful)
- Asset handling (Font Awesome, images)

**Higher Risk:**
- Major template modifications
- Changing content organization significantly

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Fix build)**: 1-2 hours
- **Phase 2 (Content)**: 2-4 hours (depending on scope)
- **Phase 3 (Template)**: 3-5 hours
- **Phase 4-6 (Polish)**: 2-3 hours

**Total estimated time**: 8-14 hours depending on scope and complexity of content restructuring.
